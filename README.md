### 🧩 Step 5: Filtered Protocols  
Used Wireshark filters:  
- `http`  
- `dns`  
- `tcp`



---

### 🧩 Step 6: Protocols Identified  
Identified the following protocols:  
- **HTTP** – Web browsing  
- **DNS** – Domain name resolution  
- **TCP** – Underlying transport layer

### 🧩 Step 7: Exported Capture File  
Exported `.pcap` file using:  
File → Save As → `traffic-capture.pcap`



---

## 🧠 Summary of Findings

- Visited a website and pinged Google.  
- Captured 500+ packets.  
- Identified protocols: TCP, DNS, HTTP.  
- Used filters to isolate specific traffic types.  
- Saved capture for future inspection.
